Here's a "fun" integral (just to test if MathJax is working properly)

$$ \int^{\infty}_{-\infty} \frac{dx}{(e^{x} - x)^2 + \pi^2} = \frac{1}{1+\Omega} $$

Along with a little bit of inline MathJax: $$x$$, $$y$$, $$z$$, $$\rho$$

Now lets go for syntax highlighting, first with Ruby:

```ruby
def foo
  puts 'foo'
end
```
Now we shoot for Python:

```python
for i in range(10):
    print(i)
```

And let's do C for safe call

```c
void XorSwap( int* x, int* y ) 
{
  if (x != y)
  {
    *x ^= *y;
    *y ^= *x;
    *x ^= *y;
  }
}
```

Time for some pictures as well!
